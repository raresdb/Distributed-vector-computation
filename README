# Butilca Rares

Description:

    This program runs a number of processes that colaborate on computing a vector.

Topology:

    There are 4 clusters united through their leaders with ranks 0, 1, 2 and 3.
    These leaders are connected in a ring in the order 0, 1, 2, 3, 0.
    Each leader is connected directly to the workers from their cluster.
    The workers can communicate only to their leader.

Error_types:

    0: No error.
    1: The link between 0 and 1 is broken.
    2: 1 is completely separated from the rest of the topology.

Task:

    Process 0 will generate a vector of length N using the rule V[K] = N - K - 1.
    This vector will be passed to the workers through the links in the topology and then processed.
    Each element has to be multiplied by 5 and then printed by process 0.
    Each worker will be assigned a part of the vector to process.

Outputs:

    First the topology must be established.
    Thus the processes will learn about the topology and print the clusters that they can reach.
    Also, the final vector will be printed by process 0.
    Each message sent will be marked with a message to the console with the source and destination.

Run:

    For changing the parameters of the program, check the Makefile.
